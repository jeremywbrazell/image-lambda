# image-lambda

I was a witness to the mob-coding session with Alex in which we were trying to accomplish the following:

1. get an image
1. edit the image
1. upload the image

There was a blocker with the buffer where were weren't able to return it.  Only the byte amount.  To be perfect honest, I am still a tad unsure as to what the end result is supposed to look like.  We did try a few different things like creating an empty array in the images.json file and then trying to push to it, but, that didn't seem to work.
